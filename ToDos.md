## Hans
- After the page has finished loading, visit heroku...../hello
	hello > will return the number of visits of the user, more importantly if the system has been ideling for a while, it takes a few seconds to get back to running. Calling hello in the beginning will make sure everything is up and running once we reach rendering...
